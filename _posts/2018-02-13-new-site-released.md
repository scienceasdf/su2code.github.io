Today, we proudly present the new SU2 project website! We have released this new website with our community in mind: all of the source code, documentation, and tutorials now live under this one repository, and it is all modifiable openly by the community. The goal is to make it easy for anyone to contribute new documentation and tutorials for the benefit of everyone! Plus, we needed a makeover.

This site is based on the [jekyll-doc-theme](https://aksakalli.github.io/jekyll-doc-theme/) released on GitHub under the [MIT license](/su2/Tutorials/jekyll-doc-theme-license). We greatly appreciate their contribution to the open source! Special thanks also to Rubén Sánchez Fernández for intitiating the website overhaul.
